    TimescaleDB Single Helm Chart error:

    You should configure the bootstrapFromBackup in your Helm Chart section by explicitly setting
    the repo1-path to point to the backups.

    For example, if you want to do a disaster recovery, and you want to reuse
    the backup, you could configure the path as follows:

    ```yaml
    bootstrapFromBackup:
      enabled: true
      repo1-path: {{ (printf "/%s/%s/" .Release.Namespace (include "clusterName" . )) | quote }}
