This Certificate is used by PostgreSQL to serve SSL connections

The auto-generated certificate is generated for every invocation of Helm install/upgrade.
This should not be a major issue, as a self-signed certificate is snake oil and does not allow
for any trust in the authenticity of the server.

To prevent the regeneration of the certificate, we can use a pre-install Helm hook,
however that would leave no option for reissuing the certificate using this Helm chart,
nor would the certificate be removed with a Helm delete command

If a trusted certificate is required, it should be included in the values.yaml in the
tls section.
