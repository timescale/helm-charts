{{/*
The sole purpose of this job is to trigger Patroni to rewrite the
Dynamic Configuration[1] in the DCS.

As the configuration may change between every invocation of Helm, we
need to run this trigger after every update.

To prevent Helm failing to update a deployment, we add some random characters
to the created job; Helm cannot create a job with the same name,
however, (completed) jobs will not immediately be removed by Kubernetes.
