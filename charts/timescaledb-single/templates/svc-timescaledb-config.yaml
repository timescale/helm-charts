This service allows internal connections to the Patroni Api.

The current implementation does not protect this API endpoint,
therefore we do not want it to be exposed together with
the PostgreSQL service (every client would then be able to
reconfigure Patroni).

This Service would have been created by Patroni if it would
not be part of this Helm Chart. The only thing we do here
is to add the labels, selector and port. The underlying Endpoints
is used by Patroni to store the configuration.
