# TimescaleDB Single

This directory contains a Helm chart to deploy a three
node [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/) cluster in a
High Availability (HA) configuration on Kubernetes. This chart will do the following:

- Creates three (by default) pods using a Kubernetes [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).
- Each pod has a container created using the [TimescaleDB Docker image](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-docker-ha).
  - TimescaleDB 1.6 and PG 11
- Each of the containers runs a TimescaleDB instance and [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) agent.
- Each TimescaleDB instance is configured for replication (1 Master + 2 Replicas).

When deploying on AWS EKS:
- The pods will be scheduled on nodes which run in different Availability Zones (AZs).
- An AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is configured to handle routing incoming traffic to the Master pod.

When configured for Backups to S3:
- Each pod will also include a container running [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/).
- By default, two [CronJobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) are created to handle full weekly and incremental daily backups.
- The backups are stored to an S3 bucket.

## Installing

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install --name my-release charts/timescaledb-single
```

You can override parameters using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`,
e.g., to install the chart with backup enabled:

```console
helm install --name my-release charts/timescaledb-single --set backup.enabled=true
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,
```console
helm install --name my-release -f myvalues.yaml charts/timescaledb-single
```

For details about what parameters you can set, have a look at the [Administrator Guide](admin-guide.md#configure)

## Connecting to TimescaleDBs

To connect to the TimescaleDB instance, we first need to know to which host we need to connect. Use `kubectl` to get that information:
```console
kubectl get service/my-release
```
```
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                 PORT(S)          AGE
my-release   LoadBalancer   10.100.149.189    verylongname.example.com   5432:31294/TCP   27s
```

Using the External IP for the service (which will route through the LoadBalancer to the Master), you
can connect via `psql` using the following (default example superuser password is `tea`)

> NOTICE: You may have to wait a few minutes before you can resolve the DNS record

```console
psql -h verylongname.example.com -U postgres
```
```
Password for user postgres:
postgres=#
```

From here, you can start creating users and databases, for example, using the above `psql` session:
```sql
CREATE USER example WITH PASSWORD 'thisIsInsecure';
CREATE DATABASE example OWNER example;
```

Connect to the example database with the example user:

```console
psql -h verylongname.example.com -U example -d example
```

This should get you into the example database, from here on you can follow
our [TimescaleDB > Getting Started](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/getting-started/creating-hypertables) to create hypertables
and start using TimescaleDB.

### Connecting from inside the Cluster

To access the database from inside the cluster, you can run `psql` inside the Pod containing the primary:

```
RELEASE=my-release
kubectl exec -ti $(kubectl get pod -o name -l role=master,release=$RELEASE) psql
```

## Create backups to S3
The backup is disabled by default, look at the
[Administrator Guide](admin-guide.md#backups) on how to configure backup location, credentials, schedules, etc.

## Cleanup

To remove the spawned pods you can run a simple
```console
helm delete my-release
```
Some items, (pvc's and S3 backups for example) are not immediately removed.
To also purge these items, have a look at the [Administrator Guide](admin-guide.md#cleanup)
