| `version`                         | The major PostgreSQL version to use         | empty, defaults to the Docker image default         |

### Creating the Secrets

The chart expects that the Secret objects referenced in `secretNames.credentials`, `secretNames.certificate` and  `secretNames.pgbackrest` are already created when deploying. The values in these secrets will be used as ENV variables to securely configure the deployment.

We've included a helper script `generate_kustomization.sh` to help generate a [kustomization](https://kustomize.io) for a single deployment. The script generates configuration for:
* strong random passwords for the database
* a self-signed SSL certificate (for demo and dev purposes)
* backup (if enabled)

The script is interactive and (if you wish to enable backups) will ask you to enter your values 
for the pgBackRest S3 config (like bucket, region, endpoint, key and secret).
It will also ask if you want the script to install the secrets directly.

```sh
charts/timescaledb-single/generate_kustomization.sh <release name>
```

The script can install the secrets immediately, it creates the following secrets:

#### Credentials 

This Secret should contain the ENV vars that will influence Patroni. It should at least contain the passwords for the 3 different database users this chart creates: postgres (superuser), admin, and standby (replication). For example, the data of the secret can be:
  ```yaml
  data:
    PATRONI_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=base64-encoded-strong-pass
    PATRONI_REPLICATION_PASSWORD=base64-encoded-strong-pass
    PATRONI_admin_PASSWORD=base64-encoded-strong-pass
  ```

#### Certificate

This Secret should be of `type: kubernetes.io/tls` with two items: `tls.crt` and `tls.key`. The certificate is used for the database connections.

> **NOTICE**: The `generate_kustomization.sh` script generates self-signed certificates that should 
only be used for development and demo purposes. 
The certificate should be replaced by a signed certificate, signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that you trust.

#### pgBackRest 

This Secret is optional, and required only when backups are enabled (`backup.enabled=true`). 
It should contain the ENV vars that influence pgBackRest (e.g. PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_KEY_SECRET)

The values in this Secret should specify sensitive variables like S3_KEY and S3_KEY_SECRET.
For example:
  ```yaml
  data:
    PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_BUCKET: <base64 encoded my_example_s3_bucket_for_backups>
    PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_ENDPOINT: <base64 encoded s3.amazonaws.com>
    PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_REGION: <base64 encoded us-east-2>
    PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_KEY: <base64 encoded examplekeyid>
    PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_KEY_SECRET: <base64 encoded examplesecret+D48GXfDdtlnlSdmB>
  ```

Another example, if you want to include encryption of your backups by pgBackRest, is to include these parameters:

```yaml
  data:
    PGBACKREST_REPO1_CIPHER_TYPE: <base64 encoded aes-256-cbc>
    PGBACKREST_REPO1_CIPHER_PASS: <base64 encoded encryption passphrase>
```

For a list of all the pgBackRest command configuration options that you can set take a look 
at: https://pgbackrest.org/command.html#introduction 
  > Any option may be set in an environment variable using the PGBACKREST_ prefix and the option name in all caps replacing - with _, e.g. pg1-path becomes PGBACKREST_PG1_PATH and stanza becomes PGBACKREST_STANZA...

### Examples
- Override value using commandline parameters
    ```console
    helm upgrade --install my-release charts/timescaledb-single --set image.tag=pg12.5-ts2.0.0-p0 --set image.pullPolicy=Always
    ```
- Override values using `myvalues.yaml`git
    ```yaml
    # Filename: myvalues.yaml
    image:
      tag: pg13.2-ts2.1.1-p1
      pullPolicy: Always
    patroni:
      postgresql:
        parameters:
          checkpoint_completion_target: .9
    ```
    ```console
    helm upgrade --install my-release charts/timescaledb-single -f myvalues.yaml
    ```
- Use an example values file to match an AWS EC2 Instance type, for example, using `charts/timescaledb-single/values/m5.large.example.yaml`:
    ```console
    helm upgrade --install my-release charts/timescaledb-single -f charts/timescaledb-single/values/m5.large.example.yaml
    ```

## Connecting

This Helm chart creates multiple [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)s,
2 of these are meant for connecting to the database.

If a Load Balancer has been configured with `enabled: True`, this Service is also exposed through a Load Balancer,
otherwise these services are [Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services)s,
which allows connections directly to indivudual pods using DNS.

### Connect to the primary
  ```console
  psql -h my-release
  ```

### Connect to a replica
  ```console
  psql -h my-release-replica -U postgres
  ```

### List the services
```console
RELEASE=my-release
kubectl get service -l release=${RELEASE}
```
In the below example you can see that
* `my-release` (the primary service) has a LoadBalancer associated with it which is exposed
    as `verylongname.example.com`.
* `my-release-replica` (the replica service) does not have a LoadBalancer, nor a ClusterIP, and therefore is a Headless Service
* `my-release-config` service is used for HA and cannot be used to connect to PostgreSQL.
```console
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                PORT(S)          AGE
my-release           LoadBalancer   10.100.245.92   verylongname.example.com   5432:31271/TCP   5m49s
my-release-config    ClusterIP      None            <none>                     <none>           4m50s
my-release-replica   ClusterIP      None            <none>                     5432/TCP         5m49s
```

## Cleanup

Removing a deployment can be done by deleting a Helm deployment, however, removing the deployment does not remove
the Persistent Volume Claims (pvc) belonging to the cluster.

To fully purge a deployment in Kubernetes, you should do the following:
```sh
# Delete the Helm deployment
helm delete my-release
# Delete pvc
RELEASE=my-release
kubectl delete $(kubectl get pvc,ep,service -l release=$RELEASE -o name)
```

### Optional: Delete the s3 backups
If you have configured backups, the S3 bucket will contain a Backup Stanza (configuration) and one or more backups. If the deployment name were to be reused
this will cause issues.

If you want to purge the backups, (re)move the s3 objects relating to your database, e.g. when using the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
```console
aws s3 rm s3://this_bucket_may_not_exist/default/my-release --recursive
```
Alternatively, you can use the [AWS Management Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) to delete those objects.

## Backups

### Create backups to S3
 the following items are required for you to enable creating backups to S3:

- an S3 bucket available for your backups
- an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html)
- a [S3 Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html) that allows the IAM user read and write access to (parts of) the S3 bucket
- access key that allows you to login as the IAM user

These configuration items should be part of the `RELEASE-pgbackrest` secret. Once you recreate this secret
with the correct configurations, you can enable the backup by setting `backup.enabled` to `true`, for example:

```yaml
# Filename: myvalues.yaml
backup:
  enabled: true
```
```
helm upgrade --install example -f myvalues.yaml charts/timescaledb-single
```

### Control the backup schedule
If you want to alter the backup jobs, or their schedule, you can override the `backup.jobs` in your configuration, for example:

```yaml
backup:
  jobs:
    - name: full-daily
      type: full
      schedule: "18 0 * * *"
    - name: incremental-hourly
      type: incr
      schedule: "18 1-23 * * *"
```
- *name*: Needs to adhere to the [Kubernetes name conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names)
- *type*: choose from `full`, `incr` or `diff`, as explained in the [pgBackRest documentation](https://pgbackrest.org/user-guide.html)
- *schedule*: A schedule, specified in [cron format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)

### Bootstrap from Backup
If you want to create a new deployment using a backup of another deployment, you can do so by enabling bootstap from backup.

This mode will instead of running [`initdb`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html), attempt a restore
using the specified PGBACKREST configuration.

```yaml
bootstrapFromBackup:
  enabled: True
  repo1-path: /namespace/deployment
  secretName: pgbackrest-bootstrap # optional
```

Restoring a different deployment using an existing deployment is possible, but can be dangerous,
as at this point you may be having 2 deployments pointing to the same S3 bucket/path.
Therefore, `bootstrapFromBackup.repo1-path` is required to be set.

If there are any other changes to be made, for example the bucket itself, you can create a secret containing that
information, for example:

```console
kubectl create secret generic pgbackrest-bootstrap --from-literal=PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_BUCKET=acme_test_backups
```

#### Example: Restore a no longer used deployment in the same namespace

- Source: test01 in namespace testing
- Target: test01 in namespace testing

> WARNING: This new deployment will - once the backup is enabled - use the same S3 bucket/path to 
> write its backup than the previous deployment.

1. Create (or restore) [secrets](#creating-the-secrets) for the new deployment in the `testing` namespace.
2. Create a new deployment using the backup of the former deployment
    ```console
    helm upgrade --install test01 --namespace testing ./charts/timescaledb-single \
      --set bootstrapFromBackup=true \
      --set bootstrapFromBackup.repo1-path=/testing/test01
    ```

#### Example: Create a clone of one deployment to another namespace

- Source: test01 in namespace testing
- Target: test02 in namespace troubleshooting

1. Create new [secrets](#creating-the-secrets) for the new deployment in the `troubleshooting` namespace.
2. Create a new deployment using the backup of the former deployment
    ```console
    helm upgrade --install test02 --namespace troubleshooting ./charts/timescaledb-single \
      --set bootstrapFromBackup.enabled=true \
      --set bootstrapFromBackup.repo1-path=/testing2/test01
    ```

### Testing restore/recovery from inside the Kubernetes cluster
Every new pod that gets created needs to copy the PostgreSQL instance data. It will attempt do do this using the backup stored in the S3 bucket if available.
Once the restore is done, it will connect to the `master` and use streaming replication to catch up the last bits.

> **WARNING**: The following procedure updates a running Deployment

Assuming that you have deployed a 3-pod TimescaleDB, we can trigger the restore test by increasing the `replicaCount` from 3 to 4.
This should create a new pod, which we can inspect to verify that the restore was done correctly.

```sh
helm upgrade my-release -f myvalues.yaml charts/timescaledb-single --set replicaCount=4
# Wait a short while for the Pod to be scheduled and available
kubectl logs pod/my-release-timescaledb-3 -c timescaledb
```
The start of the restore should look like this:
```
2019-09-04 08:05:17,495 INFO: Lock owner: my-release-timescaledb-0; I am my-release-timescaledb-3
2019-09-04 08:05:17,518 INFO: trying to bootstrap from leader 'my-release-timescaledb-0'

```
If the restore has been successful, you should see the following in the logs at some point:
```

```

> **WARNING**: The following procedure removes a running pod and its backup pvc

After testing the restore/recovery you may want to reduce the `replicaCount` back to its previous value.
To verify that we're not going to be causing a failover, we need to ensure the `master` is not running on the pod with
the highest number:
```console
kubectl get pod -l release=my-release -L role
```
```
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     ROLE
my-release-timescaledb-0   2/2     Running   0          19m     master
my-release-timescaledb-1   2/2     Running   0          18m     replica
my-release-timescaledb-2   2/2     Running   0          2m10s   replica
my-release-timescaledb-3   2/2     Running   0          96s     replica
```

If we reduce the `replicaCount` back to the original in this example, the `my-release-timescaledb-3` would be removed.

```
helm upgrade my-release -f myvalues.yaml charts/timescaledb-single --set replicaCount=3
```

You could also delete the `pvc` that was used by this pod:

```console
kubectl get pvc -l release=my-release
kubectl delete pvc/storage-volume-my-release-timescaledb-3
```

### Test restore/recovery from outside the Kubernetes cluster

> **WARNING** During the restore/recovery in this scenario you most likely will run into some issues,
> related to ownership of files, or paths that are configured incorrectly for your system.
> You should refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/recovery-config.html)
> and [pgBackRest documentation](https://pgbackrest.org/user-guide.html#quickstart/perform-restore)
> to troubleshoot those issues.

In the event that you need to restore the database in an environment outside your Kubernetes cluster,
you should follow the following process:

- Create a configuration for pgBackRest
- Restore the database
- Review/reconfigure `recovery.conf` for your purpose
- Verify a successful restore

As the database backup is created using the `postgres` user, and `pgBackRest` will try to (re)set ownerships
of files it is probably best if you execute this process as a `postgres` user on a Linux system.

#### Create a pgBackRest Configuration file
Assuming we are going to do the restore in the /restore mountpoint, which is owned by `postgres`,
we could create the file `/restore/pgbackrest.conf`:
```ini
[global]
repo1-type=s3
repo1-s3-bucket=this_bucket_may_not_exist
repo1-path=/my-release-timescaledb/
repo1-s3-endpoint=s3.amazonaws.com
repo1-s3-region=us-east-2

[poddb]
pg1-path=/restore/data
pg1-port=5432
pg1-socket-path=/tmp/

recovery-option=standby_mode=on
recovery-option=recovery_target_timeline=latest
recovery-option=recovery_target_action=shutdown
```

#### Restore the database using pgBackRest
```console
export PGBACKREST_CONFIG="/restore/pgbackrest.conf"
pgbackrest restore --stanza=poddb
```

#### Verify a successful restore
You should be able to start the restored database using the correct binaries. This example uses PostgreSQL 11 binaries on a Debian based system
```console
/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/pg_ctl -D /restore/data --port=5430 start
psql -p 5430 -c 'SHOW cluster_name'
```
If the restore/recovery/starting was successful the output should be similar to the following:
```
 cluster_name
--------------
 my-release
(1 row)
```
### Verify Backup jobs

The backups are triggered by [CronJobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/).
The CronJob triggers a backup in the TimescaleDB Pod, which in turn instructs [pgBackRest](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest) to create the backup.

To see the CronJobs and the Jobs that were created by these CronJobs, use something like the following:

```console
kubectl get cronjob,job -l release=my-release
```
```
NAME                                                     SCHEDULE     SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
cronjob.batch/my-release-timescaledb-full-weekly         27 * * * *   False     0        2m12s           8m9s
cronjob.batch/my-release-timescaledb-incremental-daily   28 * * * *   False     0        72s             8m9s

NAME                                                            COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
job.batch/my-release-timescaledb-full-weekly-1567585620         1/1           3s         2m11s
job.batch/my-release-timescaledb-incremental-daily-1567585680   1/1           3s         71s
```
To inspect the logs of a specific job:
```console
kubectl logs job/my-release-timescaledb-full-weekly-1567585620
```
```json
{
    "age": 1.0,
    "duration": 1.0,
    "finished": null,
    "label": "20190904082702",
    "pgbackrest": {},
    "pid": 40,
    "returncode": null,
    "started": "2019-09-04T08:27:02+00:00",
    "status": "RUNNING"
}
```
As the CronJobs are only triggers they should complete within seconds. That is why in the above example both `returncode` and `finished` are `null`, they are not yet known.

To verify the actual backups we can use the `pgbackrest` command in any TimescaleDB pod belonging to that deployment,
for example:
```console
kubectl exec -ti $(kubectl get pod -l release=my-release,role=master) pgbackrest info
```
```
Defaulting container name to timescaledb.
Use 'kubectl describe pod/my-release-timescaledb-1 -n default' to see all of the containers in this pod.

## Post Init Scripts
To run custom post-init steps, you can configure `postInit`, which
takes a array of [VolumeProjection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#volumeprojection-v1-core)s,
each of which can contain multiple items.

You should ensure that every script returns exitcode 0 on success, otherwise the initialization will fail.


> ... The script receives a connection string URL (with the cluster superuser as a user name) ...
[Patroni Bootstrap Documentation](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SETTINGS.html?highlight=post_init#bootstrap-configuration)

> NOTICE: Post Init is only executed after initialization of the cluster. This is a once-in-a-lifetime occurence.

### Examples

#### I want to create 2 new databases post init ####

*file: create_extra_dbs.sh*
```bash
#!/bin/bash

psql -d "$1" <<__SQL__
CREATE ROLE test;
CREATE DATABASE test OWNER test;

CREATE ROLE test2;
CREATE DATABASE test2 OWNER test;
__SQL__
```

*Create a ConfigMap from this file*:
```console
kubectl create configmap timescale-post-init --from-file=create_extra_dbs.sh
```

*Configure the postInit section*
```
postInit:
  - configMap:
      name: timescale-post-init
```

#### I also want to set the password for these users
*file: set_test_passwords.sh*
```bash
#!/bin/bash
psql -d "$1" --file=- --set ON_ERROR_STOP=1 << __SQL__
SET log_statement TO none;      -- prevent these passwords from being logged
ALTER USER test  WITH PASSWORD 'hard2guess';
ALTER USER test2 WITH PASSWORD 'harder2guess';
__SQL__
```

*Create a Secret from this file*:
```console
kubectl create secret generic timescale-post-init-pw --from-file=set_test_passwords.sh
```

*Configure the postInit section*
```
# file: post_init_example.yaml
postInit:
  - configMap:
      name: timescale-post-init
  - secret:
      name: timescale-post-init-pw
```

If you now create a new deployment, you should see something like the following in the log output of your deployment:

1. [Create the Secrets](#creating-the-secrets)
2. Install this deployment
    ```console
    helm upgrade --install postinittest ./charts/timescaledb-single -f post_init_example.yaml
    ```
3. Wait for the Pod's to be ready
    ```console
    kubectl get pod -l cluster-name=postinittest
    kubectl logs pod/postinittest-timescaledb-0 -c timescaledb
    ```
4. Verify that the scripts were run successfully
    ```sql
    SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datdba = 'test'::regrole;
    ```
    ```text
     datname
    ---------
     test
     test2
     (2 rows)
    ```
--------
 test
(1 row)
    ```

## Callbacks
Patroni will trigger some callbacks on certain events. These are:

- on_reload
- on_restart
- on_role_change
- on_start
- on_stop

If you wish to have *your* script run after a certain event happens, you can do so by configuring
`callbacks.configMap` to point to a [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.15/#configmap-v1-core). The value is templated so you can use `"{{ .Release.Name }}-patroni-callbacks"`
if you're deploying this chart in the same release with another chart that will create the config map.

This ConfigMap should exist before you install a chart. The data keys that match the event names will be executed
if the event happens. For convenience the `all` key will be executed at every event.

Every callback will be given 3 additional commandline arguments by Patroni, they are:

* action (e.g. `on_restart`, `on_stop`)
* role (`master`/`replica`)
* cluster\_name

For more information about callbacks, we refer you to the [Patroni Documentation](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SETTINGS.html#postgresql)

Inside these callbacks, you also have access to the environment variables of the pod, except the `PATRONI_` environment variables.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-patroni-callbacks
data:
  on_start: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "I just started"
  on_role_change: |
    #!/bin/bash
    curl http://${MYAPP}/
  all: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "$0 happened"
```

### Example: Register Patroni events in a table


*example-patroni-callbacks.yaml*
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-patroni-callbacks
data:
  all: |
    #!/bin/bash

    # This script should only run on the master instance, Patroni
    # passes on the role in the second parameter
    [ "$2" != "master" ] && exit 0

    psql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
          --set events_table=${EVENTS_TABLE} \
          --set hostname=$(hostname) \
          --set event=$1 <<__SQL__
      -- After a promote it may take a short while before our transaction actually
      -- allows us to write therefore we sleep a short while if we're still in recovery
      SELECT pg_sleep(3)
      WHERE  pg_is_in_recovery();

      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS :"events_table"(
        happened timestamptz,
        event text,
        pod text
      );

      INSERT INTO :"events_table"
      VALUES (now(), :'event', :'hostname');
    __SQL__
```

*myvalues.yaml*
```yaml
callbacks:
  configMap: example-patroni-callbacks

env:
  - name: EVENTS_TABLE
    value: patroni_events
```

```console
kubectl apply -f example-patroni-callbacks.yaml
helm upgrade --install example ./charts/timescaledb-single -f myvalues.yaml
```

After waiting a while, and having done some failovers, inspecting the resulting the table shows the following:
```console
kubectl exec \
    $(kubectl get pod -o name -l cluster-name=example,role=master) \
    -ti -- psql -c 'table patroni_events';
```
```
           happened            |     event      |          pod
-------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------

```

## pgBouncer
To support some forms of connection pooling, a [pgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) container can be added to the pod,
by setting `pgBouncer.enabled` to true.

Having a lot of connections doing work at the same time is very expensive, and to quote the
[PostgreSQL Wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Number_Of_Database_Connections)

> Contrary to many people's initial intuitive impulses, you will often see a transaction reach completion sooner if you queue
> it when it is ready but the system is busy enough to have saturated resources and start it later when resources become available.
>
> Pg will usually complete the same 10,000 transactions faster by doing them 5, 10 or 20 at a time than by doing them 500 at a time.

So when it comes to a lot of (re)connects from the application, or a lot of simultaneous active connections, using connection pooling
should be seriously considered, as reducing the number of connections may improve your througput quite a lot.

Connection pooling requires configuration, both on the application side and the database side, and there isn't a one size fits
all. For more information, have a look at the [FAQ](https://www.pgbouncer.org/faq.html) of pgBouncer.

The way pgBouncer works in this Helm Chart is by allowing you to connect to any database, with regular users, using their
regular database credentials.

## Troubleshooting


### List Resources
All the resources that are deployed can be listed by providing the filter `-l release=my-release`.
By adding the `role` label in the output, we get some more insight into the deployment, as Patroni adds a `role=master` label to the elected master and set the label
to `role=replica` for all replicas.

The `<release-name>` endpoint is always pointing to the Patroni elected master.

```console
RELEASE=my-release
kubectl get all,endpoints,pvc -l release=${RELEASE} -L role
```
The output should be similar to the below output:
```console

### Investigate TimescaleDB logs

The logs for the current `master` of TimescaleDB can be accessed as follows:

```console
RELEASE=my-release
kubectl logs $(kubectl get pod -o name -l release=$RELEASE,role=master) -c timescaledb
```

### Switching a LoadBalancer type
If you want to switch a service from `ClusterIP` to `LoadBalancer`, some extra work may be required.

When using Helm 3 when trying to change a value, Helm will try to patch the kubernetes objects involved.
However, due to some Kubernetes issues ([#221](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues/221), [#11237](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/11237)), this patching strategy does not always work.


```console
$ helm upgrade --install example ./charts/timescaledb-single/ --set replicaLoadBalancer.enabled=True
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "example-replica" with kind Service: Service "example-replica" is invalid: spec.clusterIP: Invalid value: "": field is immutable
```

To get around this issue, we can delete the service before we switch the type of the LoadBalancer.

> **WARNING**: This will cause **downtime** for every application that is currently using this specific service.
> Every client that is currently connected to this specific service will be disconnected and will only
> be able to reconnect if the new service has been created and is fully functional.

```console
$ kubectl delete service/example-replica
service "example-replica" deleted
$ helm upgrade --install example ./charts/timescaledb-single/ --set replicaLoadBalancer.enabled=True
Release "example" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
```

### `Could not resize shared memory segment "/PostgreSQL.1521128888" to 8388608 bytes:`

This error message occurs if you're running out of space on the `/dev/shm` Volume.
By default, Kubernetes only provides 64MB of space for `/dev/shm`, however, PostgreSQL may
require (a lot) more space depending on the work load.

This memory however is only used for the work memory for parallel query workers.
To mitigate this, you could:

- reduce [`work_mem`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM)
- reduce [`max_parallel_workers`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS)

Alternatively, you could enable the mounting of Memory to `/dev/shm`, by enabling this feature in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
sharedMemory:
  useMount: true
```

### `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "<volume name>": secret "<release>-secret" not found`

This error points to missing Secrets. Since release 0.6.0 the Secrets are no longer part of this Helm Chart and should
be managed separately.

* When upgrading a 0.5 deployment to 0.6: [Upgrade Guide](upgrade-guide.md#migrate-the-secrets)
* When creating a new deployment, or if the old Secrets are no longer available: [Create the Secrets](#creating-the-secrets)

### Incorrect pgBackRest stanza

When you get these kinds of error messages:

- `backup and archive info files exist but do not match the database`
- `system-id 6854866061727555639 do not match stanza version 12, system-id 6854865382723022903`
- `archive command failed with exit code 44`

It means that the backup stanza that was configured for your cluster contains backups of a different cluster.
This can happen if you reuse an old deployment name, or if you share a bucket between Kubernetes clusters.

The backup files that are already there belong to the previous/other deployment; we do not want to overwrite/remove
these backups automatically.

To resolve this, you could:

- If the existing backups are useless/stale, you can delete the backups.
- Point the backup to a different S3 bucket, or S3 path, by configuring the `PGBACKREST_REPO1_PATH` or `PGBACKREST_REPO1_S3_BUCKET`
- [Cleanup](#cleanup) this deployment, and create this deployment using [Bootstrap from Backup](#bootstrap-from-backup)

### `database files are incompatible with server`
If the default major PostgreSQL server has changed in the Helm Charts, you may run into
this issue when upgrading. An example of what would be shown in the logs is:

```
FATAL:  database files are incompatible with server
DETAIL:  The data directory was initialized by PostgreSQL version 11, which is not compatible with this version 12.3
```

These Helm charts do not support a major `pg_upgrade`, however you can explicitly set the major PostgreSQL version
in the `values.yaml`, for more details, follow the [Upgrade Guide](admin-guide.md#upgrading-from-06x-to-07x)
