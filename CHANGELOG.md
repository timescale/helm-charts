# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.10.0 - 2021-09-28]
This changeset introduces the ability to control the generated Kubernetes Services for the primary and replicas. It is now possible to declare the exact type of Service being generated, with support for NodePort services.

### Added
 * The new `service.primary` & `service.replica` config keys are used to configure all aspects of the generated Kubernetes clusters, offering more flexibility than in previous versions.

### Changed
 * The `loadBalancer` & `replicaLoadBalancer` config parameters have been deprecated. Their defaults have been preserved for this release, so `loadBalancer.enabled` still defaults to `true`. It is now recommended that `loadBalancer.enabled` & `replicaLoadBalancer.enabled` be set to false, and instead the new `service.primary` & `service.replica` config values should be used.

## [v0.9.0 - 2020-08-14]

The reason for the bump in minor version is that the default PostgreSQL version is changed from 12 to 13,
which is an incompatible change for older deployments.
### Changed
 * Use the PostgreSQL 13 Docker Image by default

## [v0.8.2 - 2021-01-13]
### Fixed
 * Allow `podManagementPolicy` to be specified in the `values.yaml`

### Changed
 * Update multinode Chart to work with TimescaleDB 2.0.0
 * Use Parallel [podManagementPolicy](https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#statefulsetspec-v1-apps) for faster scale-up/down.
 * Explicitly set [(Pod)securityContext](https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#podsecuritycontext-v1-core)

### Fixed

## [v0.7.0 - 2020-08-14]

The reason for the bump in minor version is that the default PostgreSQL version is changed from 11 to 12,
which is an incompatible change for older deployments.

### Added
 * The possibility to run a [`pgBouncer`](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) container in every Pod.
 * Allow clusters to be initialized from a backup
### Changed
 * Use the PostgreSQL 12 Docker Image by default
 * Use `lz4` compression method by default for pgBackRest

## [v0.6.3 - 2020-06-10]

### Changed
 * Use PG12 2.0.0-beta5 Docker Image for multinode
### Fixed
 * initdb calls in the multinode chart

## [v0.6.2] - 2020-05-29

 * Allow the full Service Spec for the primary and replica Service to be customized in `values.yaml`
### Changed
 * `timescaledb-tune` is now enabled by default
 * Default autovacuum parameters are changed to better support many chunks
 * Default the pull policy for the Docker Images to `Always`. This is mainly useful during development
### Fixed
 * Prevent noise in the diagnostic logs about missing files and very short vacuum runs

## [v0.6.1] - 2020-05-18

### Added
 * Name for PostgreSQL container port, allows for easier `kubectl port-forward`
 * Backup parameter examples around encryption
### Fixed
 * Include kustomize/example directory in the Helm artifacts. This includes new tarballs for recent releases.
 * Allow `generate_kustomization.sh` to run on MacOS

## [v0.6.0] - 2020-05-12

### Added
 * Ability to randomly create credentials, called `unsafe`
 * Upgrade guide to aid in migrating Secrets from a 0.5 or 0.4 deployment to a 0.6 deployment
### Changed
 * Remove Helm annotations from the Backup Job/Pods
### Removed
 * Recovery configuration options for pgBackRest
### Fixed
 * Failing to update Patroni no longer cascades to failing the Helm

## [v0.5.8] - 2020-05-07

### Added
 * Support for PostgreSQL 12
 * Default to PostgreSQL 11, TimescaleDB 1.7
### Fixed
 * Sequence of events to trigger the first backup/stanza-create

## [v0.5.7] - 2020-05-05

### Fixed
  * Do not cascade failure of patching Patroni to the Helm upgrade

## [v0.5.6] - 2020-05-05

### Fixed
  * Move app/chart/release labels under label key in networkpolicy template


## [v0.5.5] - 2020-03-30

### Added
 * Issue CHECKPOINTs when terminating a Pod to improve time to recover
 * Add possibility to specify LoadBalancer port
 * Allow mounting `/dev/shm` from Memory, allows bigger Parallel Query workloads
 * Ability to generate Secrets outside of Helm. This lays the groundwork for removing plain text
    secrets from the Helm deployment.
### Fixed
 * Anti-Affinity clause was using the wrong name to match pods, causing unbalanced deployments

## [v0.5.4] - 2020-02-26

### Added
 * Examples for setting up a High Throughput Cluster, or using different backup parameters
 * Ability to override archive-push/archive-get pgBackRest settings
 * Ability to use [envFrom](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#configure-all-key-value-pairs-in-a-configmap-as-container-environment-variables) to specify environment variables
### Changed
 * Update references to the latest Docker image (PostgreSQL 11.7). This also means PostGIS is now included
     in the default Docker Image
### Fixed
 * Remove all non-PostgreSQL/Kubernetes environment variables from Patroni/PostgreSQL
    A regular user in PostgreSQL has the ability to read the environment variables of the
    postmaster. Up to now, the chance of leaking secrets would have been small, but with
    commit 9708c38b, it is now much more likely that environment variables are exposed
    to the PostgreSQL processes.

## [v0.5.3] - 2020-02-04

### Changed
 * Set autotune max\_wal\_size to 60% (instead of 80%) for a dedicated WAL volume
### Fixed
 * Prevent creation of replication slots for Jobs

## [v0.5.2] - 2020-01-31

> NOTICE: When migrating from a < 0.5.x chart, the primary Service needs to be removed before
> invoking `helm update`, as the update will otherwise fail.

### Added
 * Support for multiple tablespaces at initialization time
### Fixed
 * CronJob triggering the backup (the POST request was not valid json)

## [v0.5.1] -  2020-01-21

> NOTICE: When migrating from a < 0.5.x chart, the primary Service needs to be removed before
> invoking `helm update`, as the update will otherwise fail.

### Added
 * Optionally tune PostgreSQL settings (e.g. shared\_buffers, work\_mem, max\_wal\_size) using timescaledb-tune
 * The charts are now also available in a Helm Repository
### Changed
 * The Service for the primary is now also created and managed by Helm
 * Use TimescaleDB 1.6 as the default version
### Fixed
 * Configuration changes in `patroni.bootstrap.dcs` now propagate to PostgreSQL servers, previously these settings
   were only read during bootstrap.
 * Patroni can now also use the endpoint in OpenShift
 * `pgBackRest` will not check its stanza on a replica
 * Default Backup Schedule is now set to 1 full a week and 6 incremental backups. (The previous definition mixed up
   day of month with day of week)

## [v0.3.0] - 2019-11-25

> NOTICE: When migrating from a 0.2.x chart to a 0.3 chart, please take the following into account:

- if you use the `env` key in your values, you should rewrite them from a
   plain dict into a list of [EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#envvar-v1-core)

### Added

* Add ability to [annotate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) pods in the StatefulSet
* Add ability to run any script as callback, if exposed as a ConfigMap

### Changed
 * Reduce loglevel of Patroni from INFO to WARNING
 * The values.yaml env key should be expressed as a list of [EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#envvar-v1-core)s
 * Refer to the latest minor versions for PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB

### Fixed
 * Set `unix_socket_permissions` using PostgreSQL parameters instead

 * Allow a (debug) command to run at container startup
 * Add a [Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) (by default),
   with the option to convert it into a Load Balancer

 * Rename postgresExporter to prometheus

## [v0.2.4] - 2019-11-05

### Changed
 * Point to the -latest Docker image tag for multinode by default
### Fixed
 * Always explicitly set wal directory
 * (multinode) Drop the TimescaleDB extension from the Data Nodes to allow a clean bootstrap to be done

### Added
 * A preliminary multinode Helm chart
 * Architecture diagrams
 * Allow multiple volumes for the data directory and the WAL directory
 * Documentation pgBackRest restore outside of Kubernetes environment

### Changed
 * The defined Patroni configuration is passed on (using a ConfigMap) to Patroni
 * Secrets required by Patroni are injected using environment variables
 * The defined pgBackRest configuration is passed on to pgBackRest (using a Secret as it holds credentials)
 * The entrypoint no longer points to scripts in the Docker image, this pretty much allows any Docker image
     to be used, as long as it contains PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and pgBackRest
 * Best practice PostgreSQL parameters, e.g. enable logging of connections by default
 * Open Sourced this repository as Apache License 2.0
